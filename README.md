My attempt at a GEDCOM viewer made with Python

## Credits

This code uses a basic GEDCOM example from [here](https://www.gedcom.org/samples.html)
The main GUI was beautified by using the [Forest-ttk-theme](https://github.com/rdbende/Forest-ttk-theme) by [rdbende](https://github.com/rdbende)

## TODO / Ideas
- [ ] Create executable/installer
- [ ] Replace ugly menu bar with buttons
- [ ] Language support
- [ ] Remarriage support
- [x] Ability to select gedcom file from menu
- [ ] Make plotting nicer (semi done)
- [ ] Include as much information as possible. Maybe a dynamic InfoFrame is something nice.
