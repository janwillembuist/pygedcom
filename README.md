My attempt at a GEDCOM viewer made with Python

This code uses a basic GEDCOM example from [here](https://www.gedcom.org/samples.html)

## TODO
- [ ] Create executable
- [x] Ability to select gedcom file from menu
- [ ] Make plotting nicer
- [ ] Include as much information as possible. Maybe a dynamic InfoFrame is something nice.
